## Painter
This is a game project for a college assignment. In the game, your goal is to paint the whole floor. 

### Instructions
Move by pressing the arrow keys. You'll leave paint behind you as you go. 

However, the paint is wet, and you can't cross it until it's dry. You'll paint the floor in one go, and it will dry after you're done. 

If you paint yourself into a corner, don't lose hope! Crossing the edge of the floor will wrap you round to the opposite side.
You can utilise that to reach areas enclosed by paint, and find your own way to paint everything.

If you get stuck, you can:
- undo by pressing backspace
- bring up the menu by pressing escape or control
In the menu you can choose to start again or paint a different floor instead.

In the menu, press the number key beside the option you want.
When choosing a floor to paint, the floors might go onto more than one page;
in that case, you can change page using the arrow keys.

### Ideas to make the game more interesting
- Some areas can be painted, but don't have to be,
  - because those bits of the floor are going to have furniture on top
- Move freely around the area, no grid
  - would that make it more annoying, because you could miss tiny bits?
  - It would definitely be more complex to program.
- Limit on the number of times you can cross the edge of the floor
  - indicated by the grid edge lines turning red.
