## Painter
This is a game project for a college assignment. In the game, your goal is to paint the whole floor. 

### Instructions
Move by pressing the arrow keys. You'll leave paint behind you as you go. 
However, the paint is wet, so you can't cross it until it's dry. You'll paint the floor in one go, and it will dry after you're done. 
If you get stuck with a part of the floor you can't reach, undo by pressing backspace.

### Ideas to make the game more interesting
- Some areas can be painted, but don't have to be,
  - because those bits of the floor are going to have furniture on top
- Move freely around the area, no grid
  - would that make it more annoying, because you could miss tiny bits?
  - It would definitely be more complex to program.
